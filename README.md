# Visual-C-Redistributable-Runtimes-All-in-One
This archive contains the latest version (February 2024) of all VCRedist Visual Studio C++ runtimes, installable with a single click by running the included batch file installer.

To install, run the included install_all.bat with admin privileges (right click, "Run as administrator")

The download includes the VC_Redist runtime packages for Visual C++ 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2022. Both 32-bit and 64-bit are supported. The files included are the English language version.

When doing a fresh Windows OS install, it's recommended to always install all the various C++ runtimes, which is why this all-in-one pack was created. It helps to avoid problems with programs that cause error messages like "side-by-side configuration is incorrect", or "Missing MSVCRT.DLL", "VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found", or "MSVCP140.DLL".

This package is created by us here at TPU. All files are digitally signed by Microsoft, which guarantees they are unaltered.
